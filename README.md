# Jason-Animation

This animation was made for a colleague of mine called Jason, he wanted to share his journey with Nimbus so far.

Each day shows a different thought of what he's been through and done.

It's been a pleasure working with Jason on this project.

Jason supplied the text for each day and the animation was built around it ðŸ™‚.

## Lessons Learned
It was tricky getting all the thoughts within the bubble but because i was on such a small deadline and its a small side project i did just do them using, flex, float and margins. I do feel this could be improved, possibly with grid?

The walking man animation was completely new to me and i learnt on this project. I really enjoyed the outcome.

I've only recently learnt animations and so best practices are still something i'm learning, i feel for the most part it turned out pretty well. 

Responsive design is something i'm still working on and so this could be improved. Getting static websites to be responsive is one thing but animations and svgs is still something i'm learning.
